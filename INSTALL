1) Install the RPM for your platform.

2) Make sure rpcbind is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable rpcbind.service
           systemctl start rpcbind.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable rpcbind
           service rpcbind start

   NOTE: rpcbind should be running with "-i" as an argument.  This is set
   in /etc/sysconfig/rpcbind by the RPM %post scriptlet.

3) Make sure xinetd is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable xinetd.service
           systemctl start xinetd.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable xinetd
           service xinetd start

4) You probably want to disable the firewall or figure out which ports to
   poke holes for.

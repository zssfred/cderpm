1) Install the RPM for your platform.

On Fedora 34 and higher the xinitd package is no longer included.
You can however build and install an rpm from the fc33 sources.

The .src.rpm file can be downloaded here:
https://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/buildinfo?buildID=1577957

Install the .src.rpm file, and in your rpmbuild directory's `SPECS` dir (e.g.
`~/rpmbuild/SPECS`) run `rpmbuild -ba xinetd.spec`. After successful build you
will be able to install the rpm from your rpmbuild directory's RPMS dir.

2) Make sure rpcbind is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable rpcbind.service
           systemctl start rpcbind.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable rpcbind
           service rpcbind start

   NOTE: rpcbind should be running with "-i" as an argument.  This is set
   in /etc/sysconfig/rpcbind by the RPM %post scriptlet.

3) Make sure xinetd is running:
       RHEL or CentOS 7.x:
           systemctl enable xinetd.service
           systemctl start xinetd.service

       RHEL or CentOS 6.x:
           chkconfig enable xinetd
           service xinetd start

4) You probably want to disable the firewall or figure out which ports to
   poke holes for.

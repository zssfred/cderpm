This source tree keeps the spec file, patches, and other files that are not
part of the CDE source release.  The Makefile tries to make easier to build
RPM and SRPM files.


FETCH THE SOURCE

You'll need the source for CDE to do anything:

    make fetch


Option 1: build from an existing release

The sources are downloaded from https://www.burdell.org/cde/ because the upstream
project releases on SourceForge which does not permit curl(1) or wget(1) to
easily download links.  The 'sources' file lists the source archive(s) needed
for CDE and a digest that is verified once downloaded.  


Option 2: build from an existing commit in the project's git

In this case the code is cloned from the project's central git repository. 
The commit to check out is controlled by the `cde.spec` file: if the macro
definition `_githash` is non-empty, `make fetch` will automatically clone
the repo and try to checkout the commit specified by the `_githash` macro.


BUILD THE RPM

You can build the RPM directly on your host system by typing:

    make

Note this will build on whatever system you are currently running and the
expectation is that you are using an RPM-based system, preferably Fedora,
RHEL, or CentOS.  Anything else I do not currently support, but I am more
than happy to accept patches.


BUILD AN SRPM AND USE MOCK

A better way to build once you get a comfortable release point is to build in
mock(1).  This is a chroot build jail that allows you to target other RPM-based
systems while not necessarily running the same version.  For example, on my
system running RHEL, I can build for Fedora or CentOS.  Or the other way around.

To get started, initialize the mock build root:

    mock -r centos-7-x86_64 --init

Now build the source RPM (SRPM):

    make srpm

Now build that SRPM in mock:

    mock -r centos-7-x86_64 rebuild *.src.rpm

The rebuild command will clean and initialize the root tree as well, in theory.
To remove or clean the build root, run:

    mock -r centos-7-x86_64 --clean

It's a good idea to start with --clean first and then do --init.


CLEAN THIS TREE

To get rid of files that are not tracked by git, you have two options:

    git clean -d -x -f

Or:

    make clean

The choice is yours entirely.
